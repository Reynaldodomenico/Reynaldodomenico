My name is Aldo, I’m a software developer who builds dashboards, internal tools, and cloud apps that hopefully won’t break on a Monday morning.

I enjoy working closely with product and design teams to turn “we want something simple” into “okay so it’s actually 37 edge cases”, and I enjoy it anyway ✨

Born in Indonesia, now surviving on bread, code, and cold weather in Berlin.
Self-taught, interested with frontend & UI/UX, and always trying to make interfaces that look good and don’t confuse the users.

I care a lot about clarity, performance, accessibility, and writing clean, maintainable code…
(so future-me doesn’t hate past-me 😅)
